  <h6>HOBBIES</h6>
  <h4> Winter</h4>
  <p>I absolutely love to snowboard and ski. Top tier activity for the winter.Alongside ice skating, bonfires and late night drives.</p>
  <h4> Summer</h4>
  <p> Even though we really only have 1 to 2 months of summer, we have the best lakes and mountains to traverse. Kayaking, swimming paddleboarding, jet skis, never-ending, soul-crushing hikes. Long drives with the sunset. It's a blast.</p>
  <h4> Spring</h4>
  <p> Spring is kind of a let down. It doesnt rain enough,doesn't snow enough,and isn't hot enough. Now's the time to get any important character growth, self-realization, and soul searching in.</P>  
  <h4> Fall</h4>
  <p>Now's when you bring out the sweaters and blankets. It's starting to get darker and my favourtie thing to do is to hear it rain. It would also be my hobby to cuddle and watch movies with my significant other, but I am oh so disastrously single.. so maybe next fall</p>
  <h4> All year</h4>
  <p>If you had been paying attention, you know that the top thing I love to do is drive. Rain, shine, snow, they all would look incredible from behind the wheel. There's also the little things, bowling, escape rooms, meeting up with relatives, travelling, etc.</p>
